# SmartHomePrivacy-FTL

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Federated Transfer Learning (FTL) model aimed at enhancing privacy in smart home communications. Focusing on decentralized data processing techniques to protect user data in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. By utilizing FTL, this project seeks to address privacy concerns associated with centralized data processing models commonly used in smart homes.

## Project Structure

- **`docs/`**: Contains all relevant documentation, including research papers, design documents, and methodology outlines.
- **`src/`**: Source code for the FTL model and related scripts.
- **`data/`**: Datasets used for training and evaluation. Note that actual datasets may be excluded from the repository and provided separately due to privacy and size considerations.
- **`results/`**: Outputs from model training, including performance metrics, logs, and analysis reports.
